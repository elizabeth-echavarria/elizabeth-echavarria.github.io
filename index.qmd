I am a third-year Political Science Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle interested in Environmental Politics. My research explores the political economy of critical minerals supply chain, concerning their fundamental role in the development of renewable sources of energy and enabling a just transition. 

I am a fellow of [UW's Center for Environmental Politics](https://envirpol.org/), and I will hold the position of Graduate Chair of its Colloquium Series during the Academic Year 2024-25.

My research has been recognized with fellowships by [UW's Clean Energy Institute](https://www.cei.washington.edu/), the [Oxford - Penn Social Impact Doctoral Program](https://csis.upenn.edu/residential-program/doctoral-fellows/), and awards by the [Renewable Energy Scholarship Foundation](https://www.resf-pnw.org/), and [APSA's Fund for Latino Scholarship](https://apsanet.org/diversity/fund-for-latino-scholarship/).

I hold a B.A. in Political Science from Universidad Nacional de Colombia (2014) and an M.Sc. in Public Policy from University College London (2019), which I completed thanks to a Chevening Scholarship funded by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a program and project manager at various Non-Governmental Organizations in South America, where I promoted transparency and responsible practices in the extractive sector.  

During the Summer of 2024, I was part of [EDICT's (Empowering Diverse Climate Talent)](https://elementalexcelerator.com/edict-internship-program/) Internship program at the [Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA)](https://communitysolaraccess.org/). As a Policy Data Analyst, I analyzed publicly available interconnection data across CCSA's priority state markets.
