Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "I am a third-year Political Science Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle interested in Environmental Politics. My research explores the political economy of critical minerals supply chain, concerning their fundamental role in the development of renewable sources of energy and enabling a just transition. I am also interested in non-profits research, specially their involvement in social and energy/climate justice issues.\nI am a fellow of UW’s Center for Environmental Politics, and I currently hold the position of Graduate Chair of its Colloquium Series during the Academic Year 2024-25.\nMy research has been recognized with fellowships by UW’s Clean Energy Institute, the Oxford - Penn Social Impact Doctoral Program, and awards by the Renewable Energy Scholarship Foundation, and APSA’s Fund for Latino Scholarship.\nI hold a B.A. in Political Science from Universidad Nacional de Colombia (2014) and an M.Sc. in Public Policy from University College London (2019), which I completed thanks to a Chevening Scholarship funded by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a program and project manager at various Non-Governmental Organizations in South America, where I promoted transparency and responsible practices in the extractive sector.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you would like to know more about my work or discuss potential collaborations.\nHow to pronounce my name."
